I used to think that I would like to spend my whole professional life being an HR consultant, until I was introduced to the amazing world of “COACHING”!"

I was introduced to the concept of coaching in one of the orientation programs, was keen to explore since I knew nothing about it. Within a few days of starting the program, I was hooked and coaching soon became my second love ! I completed my Masters in HR Strategy and Professional Coaching (certified by European Mentoring and Coaching Council) in 2011."

I worked with teams across multiple geographies to deliver complex organizational & people change initiatives with a focus on coaching and collaboration. So, in many ways, I was still in touch with elements of coaching in my HR profile. However, I realized that I usually gravitated towards aspects of Coaching and People Empowerment in my work activities. As if I was being pulled towards my “Calling”."

In my journey transitioning from Corporate HR to Coaching, I truly believe I have found my IKIGAI. Ikigai is a Japanese term that translates loosely to ‘reason for being’. It’s about finding passion through purpose and aligning happiness with career – a rare combination in today’s fast-paced world !"
